MapReduce 1 will make the Movie Review and Book review into a 10-point scale by finding the correct scale after running through the files.
This is the FindAverageâ€¦ classes. We will copy the code and run as A MapReduce job but for now we are looking at the difference in efficiency.

MapReduce 2 will take text file and find books/movies which are series and write to series text file
********
MapReduce 3 will take text file and write another text file for anomalies (book rating high whereas movie rating low or vice versa)
********
MapReduce 4 will take text file and give analytic on the order of the genres of books that make the Best Rated Movies
